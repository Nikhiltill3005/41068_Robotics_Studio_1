# Firefighting Drone Textures

This directory contains texture files for the firefighting drone model.

## Current Textures
- No custom textures are currently implemented
- The drone uses basic material properties defined in the SDF file

## Adding Custom Textures
To add custom textures:
1. Place your texture files (PNG, JPG, etc.) in this directory
2. Update the material references in the SDF file
3. Ensure texture paths are correctly referenced

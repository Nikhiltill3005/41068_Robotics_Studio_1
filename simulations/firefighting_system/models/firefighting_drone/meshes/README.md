# Firefighting Drone Meshes

This directory contains mesh files for the firefighting drone model.

## Current Meshes
- No custom mesh files are currently implemented
- The drone uses basic geometric shapes defined in the SDF file (boxes and cylinders)

## Adding Custom Meshes
To add custom mesh files:
1. Place your mesh files (DAE, STL, OBJ, etc.) in this directory
2. Update the geometry references in the SDF file
3. Ensure mesh paths are correctly referenced
4. Supported formats: DAE, STL, OBJ
